# PROTRACC.CO

PROTRACC.CO revolutionizes biomechanical analysis by making professional-grade movement tracking accessible to everyone. Our platform helps athletes improve their performance through AI-powered motion analysis and personalized feedback. This project was developed during nwHacks 2025, Western Canada's largest hackathon.

## üåü Features

- Upload and analyze movement videos (golf swings, vertical jumps, etc.)
- AI-powered joint tracking and movement analysis
- 3D visualization of movements

## üöÄ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js
- Next.js
- Three.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

### Backend
- Python
- Flask
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- MongoDB

## üí° Inspiration

For every aspiring athlete, biomechanics is the secret to performance improvement. Traditional biomechanical analysis often requires expensive equipment and professional coaching. PROTRACC.CO eliminates these barriers by providing accessible, affordable, and accurate movement analysis through modern technology.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. Users upload videos of their movements
2. Our machine learning algorithms track joint positions
3. The platform generates a 3D visualization
4. Users receive instant feedback and improvement suggestions
5. Progress can be tracked over time

## üíº Market Opportunity

Current biomechanics analysis solutions are often:
- Limited to high-end sports teams
- Expensive ($5,000 to $50,000 per year)
- Inaccessible to individual athletes

PROTRACC.CO democratizes this technology, making it available to anyone with a smartphone and internet connection.

## üîÆ Future Development

### Dual Camera Integration
- Implementation of perpendicular camera views for improved accuracy
- Enhanced depth perception and coordinate triangulation
- Reduction of blind spots
- More lifelike visualization

### Advanced Analysis Features
- Comparison with ideal movement patterns
- Personalized technique feedback and improvement suggestions
- Enhanced tracking accuracy
- Expanded movement library
